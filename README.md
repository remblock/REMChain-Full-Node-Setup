# REMChain-Full-Node-Setup | (Ubuntu 18.04)

#### This script will automate the entire process required to set up a full node on REMChain. A full node will enable any user including dApp developers to query the entire history of REMChain through API endpoints. Please note, before proceeding you will need to replace (api.remblock.io) and (contact@remblock.io) with your own values. These values can be found in the Nginx Reverse Proxy and SSL Certifcate section of the code.
