# REMChain-Full-Node-Setup - (Ubuntu 18.04)

#### This script will automate the entire process required to set up a full node. Please note that before proceeding you will need to replace (api.remblock.io) and (contact@remblock.io) with your own values. These can be found on the Nginx Reverse Proxy section of the code.

```
sudo wget https://github.com/remblock/REMChain-Full-Node-Setup/raw/master/remchain-fullnode-setup && sudo chmod u+x remchain-fullnode-setup && sudo ./remchain-fullnode-setup
