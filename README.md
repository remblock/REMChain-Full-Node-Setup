# REMChain-Full-Node-Setup - (Ubuntu 18.04)

#### This script will automate the entire process required to set up a full node. Please note, before proceeding you will need to replace (remblock.info) and (contact@remblock.io) with your own values. These can be found in the Nginx Reverse Proxy and SSL Certifcate section of the code.
